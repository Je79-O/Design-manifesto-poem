    <h1>The Might Could Social Media Manifesto</h1>
    <div>Here is the method, really!!!</div>
    <p>Art and things to think about <span>sometimes</span>.<p> 
    <p> <br> <a href="https://1000manifestos.com/the-might-could-social-media-manifesto/">1.I will make art for myself, not for likes.</a></p>
     
    <p> 2.I will post my art even if I think it’s not that great.</p>
    <p> 3.I will not try to do it all.</p>
    <p> 4.I will sometimes take a break and unplug.</p>
    <p> 5.I will be inspired by, not discouraged by, other art I see.</p>
    <p> 6.I will not measure my value by likes and followers.</p>
    <p> 7.I will measure my value by what I create.</p>
    <p> 8.I will make my art, and share it with the world.</p>

   <p2> The art that is made is done for one</p2>
    <p2>is one that is made to better oneself</p2>
    <p2>do not make it only for others approval.</p2>
    <p2>In a way to get better we must try to improve our</p2>
    <p2>skills by multiple angles and horizons</p2>
    <p2>trying to make something is not always easy.</p2>
    <p2>Even the experienced will need to think before they complete a piece.</p2>
    <p2>To be able to give your best you must rest to find inspiration around you.</p2>
    <p2>The artworks of others are ones that we must</p2>
    <p2>see as new ideas and surprises and not comparison for where we should be.</p2>
    <p2>What we see in what we do must not be done for a rush or for fame</p2>
    <p2>it is a skill you learned to see if your dream be made.</p2>
   <p2>We can see what we do by what we make in order to improve and make</p2>
    <p2>it shine.</p2>
    <p2>The passions we make can be shared with others to see.</p2>
